Log:
I got the task of making a maze game, what do i need?
1.Buttons: Buttons for North South East and West
2.Labels:  I need the Labels to explain where in the map they are
3.Array: I need a 3D array so i can store all of the data for the map and add a 
position to the players
4. A Gui for the program to have a face for the user to interact with
5. A Position argument for the program to know where the user is
6. A Check Position for the program to check the current available position, and 
directions to enable or disable all of the buttons

First i created the gui with the minimal viable specs which are listed above. 
I created this with the algorithm that i had typed up and so i could simply 
follow it and create a program where the user could move around the map(Array).

After testing after each feature was implemented, when the minimal specs were 
added, i did a big test through the whole program making sure it all worked 
correctly without any unwanted buggs. After this testing i had to make the program 
dry and make it clean, label every part and explain how it all worked.

Next i had to add in a feature where the labels will have the correct grammar and 
the buttons will change colour when they are disabled. This was important because it made
 it easier for the user to know what directions are available to travel and which aren't.

After testing these until they worked i had to make these dry, I also started writing up 
each of the next things i needed to add.

I now want to add in a feature where you can accept a quest, take have an inventory, 
and have a minigame where you can click the minigame button. This has taken a while because
 it was very messy with things all over the place with all of the globals i am making to 
allow the quests to work properly.

After the testing i was able to get it all to work, and have been able to make it dry 
enough to be acceptable, but i would still like to make it more dry, and one thing that i
 have noticed is it has a little bit of lag once one of the quests have been started and 
that needs to be sorted out.

Now i want to add in a login feature where you can save your game, load your game, and 
create a new game file. This won't be too hard, the hardest part is keeping the game and 
login able to use the same window, and reset all the widgets without crashing.

After the testing i was able to finally get it all to work, the only issue i have now is 
that the Window status at the previous size set by the maze game, and that is because the 
maze game is bigger than the login window but it all works and the game can be saved and 
loaded using an array that is saved into a text document that will load up all the necessary 
variables for the game. This is also how i have managed to compact the quest feature of the
 game even more and make it less laggy, because i was able to add an array for the quest 
feature that meant i has less variables to check for, because i only needed to look inside
 of the array instead of running through a lot of if variables.

Now it's time to try and make the game more pleasing to the eye. I have been testing around 
with the abilities i have to change the look of things, but now i need to make it a pleasing 
thing to actually look at.
